|     |                      |                                                                                           |

| 1   | User Interface       | How users will consume and interact with your application.                                |
| 2   | Routing              | How users navigate between different parts of your application.                           |
| 3   | Data Fetching        | Where your data lives and how to get it.                                                  |
| 4   | Rendering            | When and where you render static or dynamic content.                                      |
| 5   | Integrations         | What third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them. |
| 6   | Infrastructure       | Where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).      |
| 7   | Performance          | How to optimize your application for end-users.                                           |
| 8   | Scalability          | How your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.                         |
| 9   | Developer Experience | Your teamâ€™s experience building and maintaining your application.                         |

\*For each part of your application, you will need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools such as libraries and frameworks.

## 2. What is React?

> [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) is a `JavaScript library` for building interactive **user interfaces(UI)**.

By library, we mean React provides helpful functions to build UI, but leaves it **up to the developer where to use** those functions in their application.

## 3. What is Next.js?

> [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) is a `React framework` that gives you building blocks to create web applications.

By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
